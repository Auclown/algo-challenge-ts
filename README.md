# 100 Algorithms Challenge
### Inspired by a Udemy course [:link:](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-algorithms-challenge/)

#### Language used:
Typescript

#### Plan:
Give a try to every algorithms from the course by myself first, and check the solution.

* All attempt.ts files are my attempt to write the algorithm.

* All solution.ts files are the solution written by the instructor Dylan Israel during the lecture.

#### Tasks I could not complete:

* 019_avoiding-obstacles

* 020_bishop-and-pawn

* 021_box-blur
